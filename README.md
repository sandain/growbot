Environmental monitoring web app for green houses and gardens. Using a Raspberry Pi, Bosch I2C sensors, Atlas Scientific I2C sensors and peristaltic pumps, and I2C motor controllers, a garden or green house can be monitored and controlled from any web-cabable device.

This project is in the early stages of development. The hardware drivers are currently the main focus.
