=head1 NAME

Device::lm_sensors - Driver for sensors supported by lm-sensors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use utf8;
  use v5.10;

  use Device::lm_sensors;

  # Setup lm-sensors to read the CPU temperature on a Raspberry Pi.
  my $chip = 'cpu_thermal-virtual-0';
  my $device = 'temp1';
  my $value = 'temp1_input';
  my $lm_sensors = Device::lm_sensors->new ($chip, $device, $value);

  # Measure and print the CPU temperature.
  printf "CPU temperature: %s Â°C\n\n", $lm_sensors->measure;

  # Close the device.
  $lm_sensors->close;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Device::lm_sensors is a driver for sensors supported by lm-sensors.

=head2 Methods

=over 12

=item C<new>

Returns a new Device::lm_sensors object.

=item C<close>

Closes input/output to the device.

=item C<measure>

Get a measurement from the device.
